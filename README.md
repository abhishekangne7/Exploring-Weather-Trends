# Exploring-Weather-Trends
The project compares the rising temperature averages for New York (United States) and Dublin (Ireland) to the global averages and to each other to understand weather trends.

Nature is the most important part of our lives and taking care of it is one of our essential needs for a longer survival. This project analyzes weather trends and looks at how the earth has been heating up over a span of approximately 250 years. 

Goal: To compare rising temperature averages for New York (United States) and Dublin (Ireland) to the global averages and to each other to understand weather trends.

Story: Iâ€™ve always wanted to travel to the city of New York, which is why New York is a part of my analysis. In the year 2019, I moved to Dublin to study MSc. in Data Analytics. Through this analysis, I want to look at the weather conditions of these two technological hubs in the world of Analytics. Also, this nano-degree by Udacity is a step further in refreshing and shaping my skills as an Analyst amidst the quarantine due to COVID-19 and a big thank you to Udacity for providing the opportunity. 

See, what I learned from this project! :)
